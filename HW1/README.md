    Overall, this assignment went well, though I did struggle with 
    adding a 'hero' image to my website.
    This is something that I struggled with in Web Design last semester as well. 
    I always figure it out eventually,
    but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Luckily for this assignment, 
    I got it working relatively easily 
    compared to the past. 

    Other than the background image, I didn't have any other issues, 
    though this assignment was a good refesher on 
    some things that I had forgotten from last semester. 
    There are some features on the site that I probably didn't 
    need to add, but I did just to practice some of the things 
    I learned last semester so I don't forget. 
    These features included interactivity when hovering the sections 
    and adding the hero image.
    The site would have been perfectly fine without hover effects and
    a background image, but why not add it.
