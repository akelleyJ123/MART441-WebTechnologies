## Ai homework response: 

Surprisingly, ChatGPT did the homework almost exactly like I did.
The comments were a little different and html page was slightly more stylized with fonts and text color being set. 
The AI also added an image to the main screen which makes sense because although the addition of an image was optional in the description, it doens't seem like the AI took it as optional and added it anyway.

I didn't give the AI any direction when it came to answers for the questions, so it is interesting to see what it gave as answers. The most interesting part about its answers are for the websites. Two of them are graphic design focused websites and being a graphic designer, it is strange that it would give me those answers especially since I haven't ever used ChatGPT for anything graphic design related. It may be coincidence, but it is strange. 

The only other thing that it did differently from my version is that when defining the variable for the question/response, it used **let 'variable name' =**  instead of **var 'variable name' =**
