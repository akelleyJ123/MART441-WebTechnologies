**Reflection**

This week was a little bit of a challenge. It was a big jump from printing a few things in the 
console last week and I don't think I was prepared for the difference in difficulty.
This week's assignment took me a very long time because I didn't quite know how changing text in the DOM worked and it took a while to figure out what I was doing wrong when something wasn't working.
Getting it all done though, I understand how all the new ideas work together and the increased difficulty helped me learn a lot. The one thing I was never able to figure out was how to make the buttons disappear after making a choice. Instead, my code just adds new buttons below the old ones so it doesn't look great. Even so, the code works, it's just not as visually appealing.

Chat GPT did the homework entirely different from what I did. It not only used almost exclusively const variables rather than let or regular variables, but it also made buttons disappear. If I'm being honest, I have absolutely no idea how its code worked which is why it making buttons disappear didn't help me in the slightest with my version of the assignment.
