Unlike last week, the homework this week didn't take me nearly as long.
I did struggle a little bit getting started with the homework, but once I 
got rolling, it was smooth sailing. This week was the first time that 
I used ChatGPT for debugging. There were a few times where I just couldn't get 
my code to work right so I put it in ChatGPT and it told me exactly what was wrong with it.
Strangely enough, I did have one issue that it couldn't figure out. I was trying to clear the previous
choice when going to a new page, but it just wouldn't do it and ChatGPT didn't know what was wrong either. I eventually figured it out and of course the issue was some little line of code I didn't even
remember writing. Regardless, it was surprising that GPT couldn't figure it out either.

Unlike last week, ChatGPT's version of this assignment was done very different from what I had done.
I feel like ChatGPT has a tendency to make these assignments much more complex than they need to be
and the code is often much more advanced than what I have created. I have a feeling that this will be
a theme throughout the semester. It just makes me less likely to use it for much more than debugging
because I have no idea how its versions of assignments work.
