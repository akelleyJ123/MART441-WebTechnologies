This week's assignment was a pretty significant challenge for me. I went into the assignment 
thinking I had a pretty good grasp on how to use arrays, but I had a difficult time implementing it 
into the assignment. I relyed pretty heavily on the example to complete the homework, but used it as 
a way to better understand how the program worked. After going through the example and creating my own 
version of the assignment, I feel as though I have a much better grasp on how it works, and how arrays are implemented. I was also able to do a little debugging this week because my images weren't displaying at first when they were being flipped. As it usually goes, there was just one line of code messing everything up, but I got it figured out. 

As is the common theme, I am not entirely sure how the program that ChatGPT cooked up works. It gives a nice little breakdown of why the code works, but just looking at the code, it's not something I could recreate on my own. Everytime I think I know how the assignment is meant to be done, ChatGPT comes along and creates something completely different, yet somehow still does the same thing.
