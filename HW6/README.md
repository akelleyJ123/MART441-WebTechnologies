This week took me a while, but it was much easier for me than last week. The example was helpful as a baseline to get started, but I moved away from it quite a bit because I had used it so much last week. This project took me quite a while but most of the time spent was debugging. For this, I used ChatGPT to help find issues where my code was getting stuck and solutions to my problems. Overall, this week wasn't a huge challenge, though most of it was spent problem solving. Everything works as it's meant to, though I did get a little lazy and just use a button to display the results on the game page rather than have an entire page dedicated to the results. Regardless, the results still display how they are meant to.
