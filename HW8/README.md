This week's homework took a lot longer than I expected though not because it was too difficult. The main reason for this was debugging time. Jquery isn't very difficult to understand, but its components interact with eachother in a ton of strange ways so if everything wasn't in the perfect order, things would break. I found the biggest culprit for this was animate(). It made a lot of things get stuck in loops, and not the good kind of loops that I was going for. The one thing I didn't get done was adding shapes to the page. I looked but could not figure out how one would go about that. Instead, I just made images that look like shapes so if we could just pretend like I added real shapes that would be awesome. Overall, this week I had fun learning about the quirks of jquery and definitely added real shapes to my project.
