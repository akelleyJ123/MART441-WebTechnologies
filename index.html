            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h4>
                I am a senior in my last semester of the Media Arts Program.
                My main focus is graphic design, and although logo design
                is my main area of work that I have done and plan to do, I have 
                been interested in book cover design recently. I am hoping that
                once I graduate and get my feet under me, I can focus on expanding
                my work entirely into book cover design.

            <h1>Interests/Game Memory</h1>
            <h4>
                Some of my biggest interests are gaming and reading.
                Most of my free-time is spent doing one of the two.
                I am currently working my way through the <i>Mistborn Trilogy</i> 
                and am loving it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My best game memory has to be beating <i>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</i>.
                There's nothing like beating a boss that you have spent weeks fighting.
                The final boss alone has made Sekiro my favorite game of all time.
